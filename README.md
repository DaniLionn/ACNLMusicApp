# ACNLMusicApp
A simple app that plays the hourly music from Animal Crossing: New Leaf depending on your system time.


# Releases

You can find releases [here](https://github.com/DaniLionn/ACNLMusicApp/releases/tag/release).

# Building
This app is currently Windows only.

It requires you to have node.js and pkg installed on your machine ([node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download))

In order to build this app, install pkg (if you don't have it installe already) ```npm install -g pkg``` in your terminal and then run build.bat

Source code downloads come with the app already built.

# Running
To run the app, you have to run it in the source folder otherwise it won't work. (There's probably ways to change this but I have *no* idea how to.)
