# ACNLMusicApp
A simple app that plays the hourly music from Animal Crossing: New Leaf depending on your system time.


# Releases
You can find releases [here](https://github.com/DaniLionn/ACNLMusicApp/releases/tag/release).


# Running
In order to run the app, you have to have node.js installed on your machine. ([node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
You also have to run it in the source code folder, otherwise it won't work. (There's probably ways to change this but I have *no* idea how to.)


# Building
This app is currently Windows only.

It requires you to have node.js and pkg installed on your machine 

In order to build this app, install pkg (if you don't have it installed already) ```npm install -g pkg``` in your terminal and then run build.bat
